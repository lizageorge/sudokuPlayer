Submission for my APCSA Final Project.

I worked on this from May 26th to June 1, right up until the submission deadline lol. It was a lot of fun, and learning how to create a GUI using Java Swing was tricky.

Building a project from start to finish under a time constraint was also somehting new to learn. I purposefully picked a project with a really simple Least Viable Product that I could add a bunch of smaller features onto later. That guaranteed that I could at least have something to submit for the grade, but I could continue working on ti to make it more impressive if I wanted to. 

Maybe I'll revist this in the future? There are some things I could add, like
- a dark mode (I'm not sure why I want that so bad but I do)
- a way to continuosly check for completion instead of the button
- a way to record the time it took to complete a puzzle, and maybe even tracking fo previous time
- (this one's the hard one but) an actual sudoku problem generator. Currently I'm just using a few problems copy-pasted from online sources (four total) and that should be expanded. But maybe I can figure out some kind of algorithm to actually generate my own problems. Idk but that would be an entire project on its own
- maybe if I ever try and move on to mobile development I could use this as a kind of template to make an app. My CS teacher said it might be easily translatable to Android Studio. Or maybe I could make a web app out of it using React JS.

That's all I can think of for now. Anyways, now my very last final is submitted, and my Junior year of high school is basically done :flushed: . I'm off to start enjoying my summer now.
